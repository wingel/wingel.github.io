I might put small code snippes in my blog pages.  Personally I
consider using such things as "fair use" and I'm not sure if it even
needs a license.  Unless some other license is specified, you can
consider any code on the blog as public domain, basically, do whatever
you want with it and attribution is not needed, although it would be
appreciated.

If you need a more formal license for legals reasons, you can choose
to use the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
